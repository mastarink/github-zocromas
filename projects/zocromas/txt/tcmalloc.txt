ENV

TCMALLOC_SAMPLE_PARAMETER 	default: 0 	The approximate gap between sampling actions. That is, we take one sample approximately once every tcmalloc_sample_parmeter bytes of allocation. This sampled heap information is available via MallocExtension::GetHeapSample() or MallocExtension::ReadStackTraces(). A reasonable value is 524288.
TCMALLOC_RELEASE_RATE 	default: 1.0 	Rate at which we release unused memory to the system, via madvise(MADV_DONTNEED), on systems that support it. Zero means we never release memory back to the system. Increase this flag to return memory faster; decrease it to return memory slower. Reasonable rates are in the range [0,10].
TCMALLOC_LARGE_ALLOC_REPORT_THRESHOLD 	default: 1073741824 	Allocations larger than this value cause a stack trace to be dumped to stderr. The threshold for dumping stack traces is increased by a factor of 1.125 every time we print a message so that the threshold automatically goes up by a factor of ~1000 every 60 messages. This bounds the amount of extra logging generated by this flag. Default value of this flag is very large and therefore you should see no extra logging unless the flag is overridden.
TCMALLOC_MAX_TOTAL_THREAD_CACHE_BYTES 	default: 16777216 	Bound on the total amount of bytes allocated to thread caches. This bound is not strict, so it is possible for the cache to go over this bound in certain circumstances. This value defaults to 16MB. For applications with many threads, this may not be a large enough cache, which can affect performance. If you suspect your application is not scaling to many threads due to lock contention in TCMalloc, you can try increasing this value. This may improve performance, at a cost of extra memory use by TCMalloc. See Garbage Collection for more details. 





TCMALLOC_SKIP_MMAP 	default: false 	If true, do not try to use mmap to obtain memory from the kernel.
TCMALLOC_SKIP_SBRK 	default: false 	If true, do not try to use sbrk to obtain memory from the kernel.
TCMALLOC_DEVMEM_START 	default: 0 	Physical memory starting location in MB for /dev/mem allocation. Setting this to 0 disables /dev/mem allocation.
TCMALLOC_DEVMEM_LIMIT 	default: 0 	Physical memory limit location in MB for /dev/mem allocation. Setting this to 0 means no limit.
TCMALLOC_DEVMEM_DEVICE 	default: /dev/mem 	Device to use for allocating unmanaged memory.
TCMALLOC_MEMFS_MALLOC_PATH 	default: "" 	If set, specify a path where hugetlbfs or tmpfs is mounted. This may allow for speedier allocations.
TCMALLOC_MEMFS_LIMIT_MB 	default: 0 	Limit total memfs allocation size to specified number of MB. 0 means "no limit".
TCMALLOC_MEMFS_ABORT_ON_FAIL 	default: false 	If true, abort() whenever memfs_malloc fails to satisfy an allocation.
TCMALLOC_MEMFS_IGNORE_MMAP_FAIL 	default: false 	If true, ignore failures from mmap.
TCMALLOC_MEMFS_MAP_PRVIATE 	default: false 	If true, use MAP_PRIVATE when mapping via memfs, not MAP_SHARED.
